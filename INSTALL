Requirements:

Note: Copy the tags file to /usr/local/bin. Otherwise, specify the tags file on the command line with the "-b" flag.

cp ./tags /usr/local/bin
cp ./MIBparse.pl /usr/local/bin

Ensure that /usr/local/bin is a part of the $PATH. You will now be able to run the tool from anywhere on the filesystem.

An example snmpwalk output of one of my machines is included as an example that can be used with the tool. The file in question is called "public.txt".
